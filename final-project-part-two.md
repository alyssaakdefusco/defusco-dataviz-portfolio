# User research 

## Target audience

The target audience for my project can fall into a few categories: The average person who is civically minded/politically involved; the arts community including managers, teachers, artists, and art students; or representatives who vote on policy/funding. I only realistically will be able to conduct research with the first 2 categories of people, but luckily I have many people both in and out of the arts community that I can interview. 

Iâ€™m interested to see if the user finds a logical connection between the elements of my story and if they find it persuasive and/or effective.




## Interview findings

**Following the narrative:** 

Question 1: Do you have a clear picture of the story was being told?

Question 3: Could you implement the call to action?

**Effectiveness:**

Question 4: What parts did you find compelling?

| What parts did you find compelling? | The visualizations about declining arts funding over the years |
| What parts did you find unclear or confusing? | Nothing really |
| Were the visualizaitons helpful or harmful? How so? | They were helpful, it would be cool to dive into more specifics about the states and use more contrasting colors! |



# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A clearer explanation is needed for the "how" of the funding piece | Rework the data viz and add more copy to give context. |
| Use more contrasting colors in visualizations                                         |   Play with color palettes in charts to see what is most effective, fix the text that is not showing up in dark mode                                                                              |
|  A bigger focus on the compelling elements like the benefits of arts ed is needed                                        |  I will find more data/ create more visualizations to show this                                                                               |


>In general I have some cleaning up to do of the visualizations and adding more compelling visual elements to enhance the story being told, but I'm happy with the way the narrative is taking shape so far!
