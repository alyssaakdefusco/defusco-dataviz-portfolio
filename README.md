# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.

# About me
Hi, I'm Alyssa DeFusco. I'm currently a masters candidate at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. I am in the Master of Arts Management program and will graduate in May of 2025! I hope to work in education, community engagement, arts equity and accessibility for one of the many great arts organizations here in Pittsburgh. I was born and raised here and I'm passionate about using data and policy to bring more arts to more people. 

I live in Bloomfield with my husband, dog, and cat. We love to travel and just got back from a semester in Bologna, Italy as part of an exchange through the MAM program. I have a music degree and play piano, violin, and sing. I love reading, cooking, and hiking!

# What I hope to learn

1. How to make accessible data visualizations
2. How to make impactful data visualizations
3. The most effective designs for telling stories about inclusion in the arts.
