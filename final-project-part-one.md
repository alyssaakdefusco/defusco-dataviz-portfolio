# Outline
 
 This project will demonstrate the correlation between arts funding and student success. 95% of Americans believe that there should be more arts in school. However, arts funding doesn't receive the priority it should in order to build robust arts programming in US public schools. Starting in the 200s, the focus on STEM left arts programs without enough allocated funds. Today, we have enough data to show that students who attend schools with well-funded arts and participate in these programs are more likely to perform well in classes and graduate. This project will present data to show this correlation and make the case for more arts funding to our public schools as well as actionable steps for the average American to advocate for arts in their local schools. 



Setup: We know that the arts are good for us. Studies show positive correlations between arts participation and physical, social, and mental health. We also know that 95% of Americans think the arts belong in public schools
Conflict: Schools don't have enough arts funding to provide arts programs to all students. Other programs are prioritized, leaving the arts by the wayside. Students don't get to reap the benefits of participating in robust arts programs.
Resolution: More arts funding is possible! Here's how you can contact your local representatives to tell them you want them to support arts funding measurements in Washington.
