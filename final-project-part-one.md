# Outline
 
 This project will demonstrate the correlation between arts funding and student success. 95% of Americans believe that there should be more arts in school. However, arts funding doesn't receive the priority it should in order to build robust arts programming in US public schools. Starting in the 200s, the focus on STEM left arts programs without enough allocated funds. Today, we have enough data to show that students who attend schools with well-funded arts and participate in these programs are more likely to perform well in classes and graduate. This project will present data to show this correlation and make the case for more arts funding to our public schools as well as actionable steps for the average American to advocate for arts in their local schools. 


Setup: We know that the arts are good for us. Studies show positive correlations between arts participation and physical, social, and mental health. We also know that 95% of Americans think the arts belong in public schools
Conflict: Schools don't have enough arts funding to provide arts programs to all students. Other programs are prioritized, leaving the arts by the wayside. Students don't get to reap the benefits of participating in robust arts programs.
Resolution: More arts funding is possible! Here's how you can contact your local representatives to tell them you want them to support arts funding measurements in Washington.

# The data
I plan to use the report from the Education Commission of the States to show how much funding public schools in different states get and point out the inequities in funding spread equally throughout the country. There is also a report from the EWA on arts access in public schools that will tie in to this point. This will demonstrate the state of arts education in public schools currently and show the need for more funding to increase these programs. I will also use data from Natioanl Association for Music Education on how school funding is currently distributed to show that the funding is there, but it is not being allocated to the arts.

To make the case for why this funding should be allocated to the arts, I will use a data visualization from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences on the effects of arts education on students that demonstrates the social emotional development, cultural development, physical, and mental health development that have been widely documented to make the case for the urgency of more arts education in US public schools.

Finally, I will create a data visualization to demonstrate the process of state representatives voting for arts education funding in their states and include some easy links for any interested readers to contact their state representatives about this issue.

# Method and medium 

I plan to use Tableau to create data visualizations and Shorthand to present the project comprehensively.
