# The final data story

[Arts Funding in US Public Schools - Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/artsfunding/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II 

The biggest changes I made were adding context and narrowing down my audience (which I'll address more below). I extrapolated on some of the research I used to develop this story to provide more links to get the audience from A to B. In the visualizations, this looked like creating interactive charts to highlight different aspects of the stories. In my first line graph about the drop in arts funding, I used the Scrollmation feature in Shorthand to emphasize the dramatic drop after the introduction of No Child Left Behind. I also added some small visuals such as the people chart to show the amount of Americans who support more arts funding in schools. 

The most striking section to me is the inequity in arts access section. I really pared this down and used the scroll feature to emphasize the stark nature of the inequality in arts access between demographics. I think this is a hook that will plainly show the audience that there's a real problem that needs to be addressed and inspire curiosity on how that can be done. I also added some context to the map of the states to explain why arts funding is so unequal across the country. I think this adds valuable context to the issue so the reader can understand the general throughline of an unnecessarily complicated issue.

## The audience
 My interviews were intersting, but I realized I conducted them mostly on people who are keen on policy talk and up to date on the general nature of US bureaucracy (a lot of Heinz students and peers that have similar interests to me). The main feedback I got on my part II assignment was to narrow down the audience, so I thought it would make the most sense to tailor this to the average person. I imagine this as a featured article on NYTimes with a headline like "We all want more arts in our schools, so what's the hold up?" or something quippy like that. If I was an average person without my particular background, I'd want to be able to read that article and feel like I finally understood a small piece of the puzzle that is federal funding. Becauase of the unanimous support of more arts in schools, I think any citizen would find this compelling. So my focus became how to translate this winding story to something they could wrap their heads around.

Nothing about federal funding or bureacracy is intuitive and even I as an arts management student have spent a lot of time trying to understand this. I had some experience talking to staffers in DC for a previous class where I had to break down this issue for them and advocate for what I thought was a more effective way to distribute funding. It turns out it wasn't so different from talking to anyone off the street because most staffers (and a lot of politicians for that matter) don't have any clue about the importance and impact of arts let alone what public schools need to make their programs more effective. That was a great practice in pulling apart the story to show a clear throughline: Arts funding sucks, we need arts education, here's why the funding gets tied up, here's some suggestions for how to make it better. I followed this same storyline for my project but took out a lot of the unnecessary policy lingo to communicate the basics of these story elements. 


## AI acknowledgements

I used ChatGPT to pull a dataset from a chart I found with no access to the original dataset. I did this specifically for the chart titled "Federally Allocated Funds Make Up a Fraction of Arts Funding". 

# Final thoughts

This was a great way to put all the new skills, concepts, and tools we learned about in class into practice. Many frustrated hours wrestling with Tableau, DataWrapper, and even Shorthand were had but I'm excited about being able to take these tools into my future career. This process has truly awakened an excitement for telling stories with data (as on-the-nose as it sounds)! Especially working on my Systems Synthesis project currently, I have a much keener eye on the data we're using, why we're using it, and the effectiveness of how we visualize that. I think if I were more tech-savy, I could have done some cooler things with all the visualizations I included. I'm hoping to use this actual report as part of what I can present to future funders, advocates, voters, etc. Thanks for the fun and practical experience!
